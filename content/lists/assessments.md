description: "There will be no exams in 6.622 this term. Rather, there will be assessments\
  \ issued approximately weekly. Assessments include short problems that are similar\
  \ in scope to homework problems. Assessments will be issued at 1 pm on one day and\
  \ due before 11 pm the next day. The goal is to provide a low-stakes evaluation\
  \ of student learning rather than making evaluations based on a few high-stakes\
  \ exams.\n\nUnlike the homework assignments, you must complete the assessments entirely\
  \ on your own with no consultation or discussion with any other person. You may\
  \ use a calculator and review the course lectures/recitations, notes, book, and\
  \ handouts when completing the assessments. Please do not use other computational\
  \ tools or reference materials.\_\n\nNo solutions are available for Assessment 9."
