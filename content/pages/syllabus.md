## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 3 sessions / week; 1 hr / session

## Prerequisites

*6.2500 Nanoelectronics and Computing Systems*

## Course Overview

6.622 covers modeling, analysis, design, control, and application of circuits for energy conversion and control. As described by the IEEE, power electronics technology "encompasses the use of electronic components, the application of circuit theory and design techniques, and the development of analytical tools toward efficient electronic conversion, control, and conditioning of electric power." Students taking this class will come away with an understanding of the fundamental principles of power electronics, and knowledge of how to both analyze and design power electronic components and systems.

## Textbook

Kassakian, John G., David J. Perreault, George C. Verghese, and Martin F. Schlecht. *Principles of Power Electronics*. Cambridge University Press, 2023.
