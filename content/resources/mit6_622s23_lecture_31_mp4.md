    \ use only switches and capacitors to provide energy and charge transfer from\
    \ one voltage level to another. This lecture introduces the operation of switched-capacitor\
    \ circuits in the slow-switching limit and fast-switching limit and describes\
    \ how they can be modeled.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\L\nMore information\
