    \nRipple and EMI Filtering are important to prevent interference with other circuitry\
    \ (e.g., a power supply with an improperly designed EMI filter can easily interfere\
    \ with radios, televisions, etc., in the vicinity). Here we introduce basic considerations\
    \ and requirements of EMI filtering.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\L\n\
