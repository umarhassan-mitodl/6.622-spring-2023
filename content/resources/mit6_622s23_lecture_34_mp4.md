    \nIn this lecture, we look at soft switching for inverters, including introducing\
    \ the resonant pole inverter (RPI), and Auxiliary Resonant Commutated Pole (ARCP)\
    \ Inverter as examples. Snubbing and soft switching serve to slow the transitions\
    \ of voltage and/or current at the switching transitions. How does this affect\
    \ filter design and EMI emissions?\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\L\nMore\
