    \nIn this lecture, we do a back of the envelope calculation on semiconductor losses,\
    \ including conduction losses and switching losses. We also explore the use of\
    \ snubbers to modify the switching transitions to reduce noise, protect the semiconductor\
    \ devices, and reduce internal device dissipation.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\
