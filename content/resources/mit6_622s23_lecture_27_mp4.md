    \nIn this lecture, we introduce current-mode control (CMC), in which we control\
    \ a converter based on both inductor current and output (capacitor) voltage. Methods\
    \ for generating linearized, averaged models of peak current-mode controlled converters\
    \ are described, along with methods for modeling and managing the small-signal\

In this lecture, we introduce current-mode control (CMC), in which we control a converter based on both inductor current and output (capacitor) voltage.Â Methods for generating linearized, averaged models of peak current-mode controlled converters are described, along with methods for modeling and managing the small-signal ripple instability that can occur in such converters.
