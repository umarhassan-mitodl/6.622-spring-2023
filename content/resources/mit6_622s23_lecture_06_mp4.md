    \nThe operational capabilities of a converter are heavily influenced by switch\
    \ implementation. Switch implementation, external networks, and control are used\
    \ in analyzing converters and identifying power flows. The inverting buck-boost\
    \ converter is introduced as an analysis example.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\
